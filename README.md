# Recommending Businesses for the Community of Montgomery in Calgary

Calgary is one of the fastest growing metropolitans in North America. Calgary small businesses account for 95 percent of all businesses in the city. Every year, an average of 4 to 5 percent of businesses decide to relocate because of operational costs or inadequate market research before opening their businesses. Better understanding of communities and their demographics, therefore, is needed to select the right community for small businesses. 
In this report, community data from multiple sources have been collected, cleaned with data wrangling techniques. Communities were clustered into four clusters using K-Means algorithm with Python. Foursquare API has been used to evaluate each cluster and type of businesses in communities. 
Last, a number of venues for one of the neighborhoods (Montgomery) has been recommended based on its clustered communities and using content-based recommender system. Similar approach can be taken to recommend other business opportunities in other communities in Calgary.
